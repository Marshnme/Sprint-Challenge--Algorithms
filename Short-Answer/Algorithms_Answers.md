#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(n)
The code runs once for N and scales linearly for how many times a < n^3


b)
O(n^2)

Nested loops each running for N 

c)
O(n)

Once again scales linearly. For each N the code will run once.

## Exercise II

half the amount of total floors. Drop egg. If egg doesnt break all floors below 
are safe. Then go to half of the top amount and repeat. If it does break then go to half of lower amount and repeat. This will be 0(logn) (Binary search)
